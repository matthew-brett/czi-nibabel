    abstract = { The reproducibility of scientific research has become a point
        of critical concern. We argue that openness and transparency are
            critical for reproducibility, and we outline an ecosystem for open
            and transparent science that has emerged within the human
            neuroimaging community. We discuss the range of open data-sharing
            resources that have been developed for neuroimaging data, as well
            as the role of data standards (particularly the brain imaging data
                    structure) in enabling the automated sharing, processing,
        and reuse of large neuroimaging data sets. We outline how the open
            source Python language has provided the basis for a data science
            platform that enables reproducible data analysis and
            visualization. We also discuss how new advances in software
            engineering, such as containerization, provide the basis for
            greater reproducibility in data analysis. The emergence of this
            new ecosystem provides an example for many areas of science that
            are currently struggling with reproducibility. }
