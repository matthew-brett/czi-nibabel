Nibabel is the base layer for the Nipy (Neuroimaging in Python) community of projects.  It is the basic workbench and input/output layer on which higher-level libraries can build.

Neuroimaging researchers need flexible tooling to analyze neural data. Python
and Numpy provide great power and flexibility, and Nibabel provides data
structures and common algorithms to apply Python libraries to imaging data.

Researchers using Python for neuroimaging are all but invariably using Nibabel either directly, or via a high-level library (e.g., Nilearn or DIPY).

The most widely-used alternatives to the Python/Nibabel ecosystem are:

  - C/C++ based (AFNI, FreeSurfer, FSL, ITK/ANTs), which can be combined (but hardly mixed together) in higher-level processing with shell scripting
    and some of them, GUIs; or
  - MATLAB/SPM (https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm), which bundles low-level libraries and high-level processing.

The Nipype Python library provides a regular interface in Python to all the software above,
thereby eliminating most of the incompatibilities between tools in combination with Nibabelâ€™s
read/write implementation of file formats.
Using the Python/Nibabel/Nipype framework, researchers are equipped to build powerful high-level
processing solutions such as fMRIPrep (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-018-0235-4; +200 citations 
as per scholar.google.com) without reinventing the wheel, just harnessing existing and mature OSS.
