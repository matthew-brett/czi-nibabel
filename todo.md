Chris - remind me how you recruited Dorota Jarecka and Hao-Ting Wang?
-->

A major motivation for our project has been to democratize coding in
neuroimaging.  The dominant package for coding in neuroimaging is `SPM`,
written in Matlab.  Python allows a wider range of scientists to use and
extend our work. Unlike other major software in neuroimaging, we made a strong
policy of establishing common ownership, rather than associating our code with
a particular institution.

We are well aware of the lack of diversity in contributors to Nibabel.  The
gender ratio of students in neuroscience is fairly evenly balanced, but only
3.4% of our commits are from authors we know to identify as female.  We have
made progress; in the last year, female developers contributed 18% of Nibabel's
commits.

Lack of diversity is self-perpetuating.  Despite our best intentions, the
homogeneous backgrounds of the main contributors will make us less likely to
question our assumptions about the way we work and communicate.  This is not
fair, but also, as in biology, monoculture is a risk to the ecosystem.

We want to do much more, and help others to do the same.  A large part of our
proposal is for educational outreach, using the OpenEdX platform.  We can
recruit from diverse groups by offering scholarships in the form of paid
certificates, weighted for students outside our dominant white, Western
male demographic.   Building and piloting this system will allow other projects
to do the same.  We hope this will prove important in achieving our common
goal to promote diversity in open source and science.

## Software project details

### Short description of software project (200 words maximum) (required)

Nibabel is a base library written in pure Python for working with a wide variety of brain imaging data formats as Numpy arrays.  We designed it to work two related roles: a Python workbench for researchers working with brain images, and a foundation upon which higher level libraries can build.  It is a dependency for nearly every Python library for brain imaging, including Nilearn and PyMVPA (machine learning), NiPy (functional brain imaging), DiPy (diffusion imaging) MNE (EEG and MEG analysis), PySurfer (brain surfce display), Nipype (analysis pipelines), DeepMedic and NiftyNet (neural network analysis of brain images). A total of 45 PyPI packages depend on Nibabel: https://libraries.io/pypi/nibabel/dependents

We also use Nibabel as the most basic layer of interaction with brain images, in our own work, and in teaching.  Nibabel presents an object-oriented interface to brain images, giving efficient Python access to the brain image data in the form of a Numpy array, and metadata in the form of a Python dictionary or Numpy record array.  These attributes make it relatively straightforward to build custom image processing pipelines, that filter, threshold, combine or display images.

We have been early adopters to formal software process.  We started using Git in 2007 and Github in 2010.  We required code review from 2010.  We used Buildbot for CI from 2011, Travis-CI from 2012, Appveyor from 2014, and Azure Pipelines from July 2019.

Our code coverage is 91.8%; we check on each proposed merge commit with CodeCov.
