In the last year, 18% of Nibabel's commits were from female programmers, but
the proportion has been much lower over Nibabel's full commit history, at 3.4%.

nf-core and Nextflow contributors and maintainers openly subscribe to and promote the Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct, which is displayed in our respective websites and GitHub repositories.
As a community, we strive to promote and encourage diversity and inclusiveness. Event organisers have made and continue to make an active effort to encourage, invite and economically support speakers and participants from under-represented groups. We are proposing to include 10 bursaries to speakers and participants from under-represented groups for the Nextflow conference in 2020 and produce four training events to scientists in economically disadvantaged locations. Future nf-core events will be held in new countries where possible, to further spread the community in to improve community inclusiveness. Use of distributed online platforms such as GitHub, Gitter and Slack allows anyone to join the Nextflow and nf-core communities for free.
As a technology, Nextflow continues to be pivotal in democratising high-throughput computing in life sciences. By simplifying cloud deployment according to FAIR and open source values, Nextfow provides a means for the marginalised and disadvantaged to access computational resources that were previously the domain of the privileged few.
Through the PHIND Access program we are providing Nextflow training and researcher exchanges in Tunisia. Using Nextflow, bioinformaticians in North Africa can deploy pathogen identification workflows in the cloud and perform analyses which were previously not possible in a country with a limited science budget.

## Software project details

### Short description of software project (200 words maximum) (required)

Nibabel is a base library written in pure Python for working with a wide variety of brain imaging data formats as Numpy arrays.  We designed it to work two related roles: a Python workbench for researchers working with brain images, and a foundation upon which higher level libraries can build.  It is a dependency for nearly every Python library for brain imaging, including Nilearn and PyMVPA (machine learning), NiPy (functional brain imaging), DiPy (diffusion imaging) MNE (EEG and MEG analysis), PySurfer (brain surfce display), Nipype (analysis pipelines), DeepMedic and NiftyNet (neural network analysis of brain images). A total of 45 PyPI packages depend on Nibabel: https://libraries.io/pypi/nibabel/dependents

We also use Nibabel as the most basic layer of interaction with brain images, in our own work, and in teaching.  Nibabel presents an object-oriented interface to brain images, giving efficient Python access to the brain image data in the form of a Numpy array, and metadata in the form of a Python dictionary or Numpy record array.  These attributes make it relatively straightforward to build custom image processing pipelines, that filter, threshold, combine or display images.

We have been early adopters to formal software process.  We started using Git in 2007 and Github in 2010.  We required code review from 2010.  We used Buildbot for CI from 2011, Travis-CI from 2012, Appveyor from 2014, and Azure Pipelines from July 2019.

Our code coverage is 91.8%; we check on each proposed merge commit with CodeCov.
