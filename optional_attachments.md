## Metrics of Neuroimaging package uptake

![](ann_rev_fig.jpeg)

> Usage of the MATLAB and Python programming languages (a) in general, (b) in
biomedical research, and (c) in neuroimaging research. The data in panel
a come from the PYPL (Popularity of Programming Language) Index, which tracks
Google searches for programming-language tutorials. The data in panel b show
the number of publications per year on PubMed that mention “MATLAB” or
“Python.” The data in panel c show mentions of major software packages in
functional brain imaging publications (counts on Google scholar). SPM
(statistical parametric mapping) is MATLAB based, while FSL [FMRIB (functional
magnetic resonance imaging of the brain) Software Library] and AFNI (Analysis
of Functional NeuroImages) build increasingly on Python.
