# NiTransforms: a NiBabel module for I/O of spatial transforms estimated with neuroimaging tools and their manipulation in Python

**Repository**: https://github.com/poldracklab/nitransforms (we should probably move it over to nipy, happy with that).

**Paper**: [ISBI Abstract](https://doi.org/10.1109/ISBI45749.2020.9098466) & [preprint](https://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/8aq7b).

**JOSS Submission**: Ready on the repo, was postponed due to COVID and never got back to submitting it.


As you will see, the paper itself attempted to be very educational. There we describe clearly what's the problem, why there's no other package like NiTransforms and why we see it as a module within NiBabel in the long run.

In the remaining of the document, I'll copy and paste what I can scratch out from previous CZI calls and other grants.
