Pitch

# Democratizing brain imaging through code

Nibabel is a base library for working with brain imaging formats.

We work in neuroscience.

Users.

Developers.

Using code as an ordinary part of scientific work.

Code contribution as an ordinary part of scientific work.

How we're doing that now, and how we're going to accelerate that with this
grant.

We're planning to build really good, high quality courses on brain imaging,
using our library as the foundation.  Collaboration and reproducibility by
design.

If we can make coding and contribution ordinary, we will greatly increase
diversity - and depth.
